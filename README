ES5 and DOM4 shim for all browsers with IE6 and IE7 support
based on 
https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim
https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim
https://github.com/Raynos/DOM-shim

Adding to html:
in a HEAD section
<script src="a.js"></script>
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<script src="a.ielt8.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

Same-domain limitation

IE requires that the .htc behavior file must be in the same domain as the HTML page which uses it. If you try to load the behavior from a different domain, you will get an "Access Denied" error.
Note that the domain must be exactly the same; that means that http://www.foo.com is a different domain than http://foo.com.

Goal
Main lib (a.js): 7.8 Kib of total minified and gzipped size
IE < 8 support: 2 Kib (a.ielt8.js) + 600 b (a.ielt8.htc) + 150 b (a.ie6.ielt8) of total minified and gzipped size
