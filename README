based on 
https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim
https://github.com/Raynos/DOM-shim

Adding to html:
in a HEAD section
<script src="a.js"></script>
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<script src="a.ielt8.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

Same-domain limitation

IE requires that the .htc behavior file must be in the same domain as the HTML page which uses it. If you try to load the behavior from a different domain, you will get an "Access Denied" error.
Note that the domain must be exactly the same; that means that http://www.foo.com is a different domain than http://foo.com.
